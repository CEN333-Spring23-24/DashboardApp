      <p> A DC motor is an electrical motor that uses direct current (DC) to produce mechanical force. 
        The most common types rely on magnetic forces produced by currents in the coils.
         Nearly all types of DC motors have some internal mechanism, either electromechanical or electronic, to periodically change the direction of current in part of the motor.

      <p> A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when current flows through it. 
        Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons. 
        The color of the light (corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required 
        for electrons to cross the band gap of the semiconductor.

      <p> A servo motor is a rotary actuator that allows for precise control of angular position. It consists of a motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a servo drive to complete the system. The drive uses the feedback sensor to precisely control the rotary position of the motor.
